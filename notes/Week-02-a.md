# Week 02a
2026-01-13 Tuesday

## First Half

Review:
* Introduction activity: strategy for games described as an English sentence
* Canvas Discussion boards for questions
* [Homework 01 released](), due in one week (Thursday, Jan 15) 
* [Syllabus](), and evaluation sentences

### The Need for Git (In-Class Activity)

The situation: last time, we had a driver (Gabriel) who worked on some code, that now we wish to share with the rest of the class.

This will occur for all of you when you are working with your teammates, developing your own Battlecode player, or in the future when doing in-class activities.

* What are some ways that you already know how to do this? (Assume you don't know Git)

We are now going to share code by using ZIP files. In pairs, using whatever means you know how to do or can look up with Google, create a ZIP file of your cloned `dgp-26wi` directory. Message

* What are some advantages of ZIP files?

### Java Review

### Java Class Structure

What is a Java program?

(Single-Threaded Version, which is How Each Battlecode Bot is Run)
A collection of classes, with methods (functions) that are run, in order, from start to finish, unless 

Like a karaoke song, program execution steps through line-by-line of the source code, but occasionally can jump to a different line of source code.
### Four Kinds of Java Statements

Four kinds of statements
* An assignment. `Type LHS = RHS`
* A function call `funcName(funcArg1, funcArg2, ...)`
* Flow control `if-else, while, for, switch, ...`
* Class / function definition `class Foo {`, `void run() {`

Three of them result in bytecode when compiled down

Two of them result in a *different* statement running than the one that comes next, in-order of the source code.

### Java Program 

From page 5, Chapter 1, of Head First Java, we will classify each of these statements into one of the four types. 

We'll choose one driver, and one navigator, and rotate until we've taken turns typing this via Zoom remote control

public static void main(String[] args) {

}

## Second Half

### Forming Battlecode Teams

It's now time to form teams, based on what you know about your classmates, or you can ask the instructor to match you up with someone. Use Zoom chat direct message or Canvas messaging, to coordinate the following with your chosen teammate.

Register at play.battlecode.org, use your Evergreen email address.
Respond to any email verification. One of your should create a team, get a join key, and the other(s) should join the team using that key.

### In-class Pair Programming Activity

* Review:
	* What are the two roles in pair programming?
	* How can computers are you looking at in pair programming?
	* When should you switch roles or end the session?

In your new teams, you'll join a breakout room,
* continue working on your Software Setup
* add the methods and code from this document below
* compile, and run it.

Choose one of you to be the driver, who will share their screen,
and the other will be the navigator, who will read from the document links above to help guide you.

### Navigator

In the file `java/src/week02a/RobotPlayer.java`, narrate to your driver to type the following, using the vocab words we've learned so far:
* The four types of Java statements: assignment, flow-control, function call, definitions
```
public static void run(RobotController rc) {

     while (true) {

        if (rc.getType().isRatKingType()) {

            runRatKing(rc);
		}
	}
}

public static void moveRandom(RobotController rc) throws GameActionException {

	MapLocation forwardLoc = rc.adjacentLocation(rc.getDirection());

	if (rc.canMoveForward()) {

		rc.moveForward();

	} else {

		Direction random = directions[rand.nextInt(directions.length)];


	if (rc.canTurn()) {

		rc.turn(random);

	}

}

public static void runRatKing(RobotController rc) throws GameActionException {

	int currentCost = rc.getCurrentRatCost();
	
	MapLocation[] potentialSpawnLocations 
	rc.getAllLocationsWithinRadiusSquared(rc.getLocation(), 8);

	boolean spawn = currentCost <= 10 || rc.getAllCheese() > currentCost + 2500;

	for (MapLocation loc : potentialSpawnLocations) {

		if (spawn && rc.canBuildRat(loc)) {
			rc.buildRat(loc);
			break;

		}

		if (rc.canPickUpCheese(loc)) {
			rc.pickUpCheese(loc);
			break;
		}

	}

	moveRandom(rc);
}
```

Compile it

```
./gradlew build
```
and run it in your Battlecode Client.
