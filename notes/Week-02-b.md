## First Half

### Review from Last Time
* Structure of a Java program
* Four kinds of Java statements
* [Game engine / spec updates](https://discord.com/channels/386965718572466197/386998740067680259)
* Pair programming: spawning baby rats, gathering cheese
* Homework #1 will be available for late credit until next Thursday.
* Homework #2 will be out after class today.

### Demos?

Did anyone finish the pair programming from last time and would like to screenshare?

#### Review of Update / Build / Run with Battlecode Client

in the `java` subdirectory
```
cd java
./gradlew update
./gradlew build
```

### English Language Strategy

Did anyone finish the pair programming from last time and would like to screenshare?

### Outside-of-class Meetings

It will be difficult to complete this class without working outside of class meetings.

From past experience, students had much more fun and got more done when they met with each other for screensharing and pair programming in-between classes

*BUT*

They waited until the last minute to do it.

In your teams

### The Need for Git (In-Class Activity)

The situation: last time, and in your teams, we have a driver who worked on some code, that now we wish to share with the rest of the class.
* One of you in each team has typed code and has it on their computer
* but the other teammates don't have it.

This will occur for all of you when you are working with your teammates, developing your own Battlecode player, or in the future when doing in-class activities.
### Step 1:
Write down your answers to the following questions, you'll submit them at the end.

* What are two ways that you already know how to transfer code from one person to another? (Assume you don't know Git).
* What is a pro and con of each of the two ways above?
### Step 2: Join a Breakout Room
You will join a breakout room with your team, or with other students who don't have a team yet.
### Step 3: Driver from Last Time: Make/Send a Zip File
We are now going to share code by using ZIP files. In pairs (breakout rooms), name one of you as Partner A and the other as Partner B. Using whatever means you know how to do or can look up with Google, create a ZIP file of your cloned `dgp-26wi` directory. Message and send this ZIP file to your teammate however you can (email, discord, Canvas group fileshare).
### Step 4: Navigator from Last Time: Unzip the File and Copy Files
Using your graphical shell (Windows Explorer, Mac Finder, Linux Gnautilus, etc.), unzip files from what your teammate sent you and copy them over to your locally cloned repo.

If you know how to use the command-line and the `cp` command, welcome to do so.

* What are three (or more) advantages of using ZIP files to share code?
* What are three (or more) disadvantages of ZIP files?
### Step 5: Pair Programming

Recall your pair programming answers from last time. If you don't have them, answer them again together.

Pair Programming Review:
	* What are the two roles in pair programming?
	* How can computers are you looking at in pair programming?
	* *When* should you switch roles or end the session? List at least two different conditions.
	* *How* should you switch roles? List at least two different actions before switching roles can happen.
### Step 6: Submit Answers

Now it's time to submit your answers from Step 1 and Step 4
* Pair Programming Review
* The Need for Git
