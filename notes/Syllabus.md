# Syllabus
## Distributed Game Playing in Java I
## Winter 2026

Welcome to Distributed Game Playing in Java I!

In this program, our goal is for you to gain mastery over working with strong typed references , collective intelligence, and design thinking using the Java programming language. We will be writing Java programs to play a strategy game called BattleCode.

# Accessibility and Inclusiveness
Our goal is to create an inclusive learning environment where all learners feel as welcome as possible. We aim to use all available technology and tools at an appropriate level so that the learning experience enhances and allows an effective and comfortable experience. If you would like to request access services or accommodations for a disability, please use the information at 
[Evergreen's Access Services for Students with Disabilities](https://www.evergreen.edu/offices-services/access-services-for-students-with-disabilities) . You are welcome to contact Paul personally or CC him on emails with Access Services. If you are a continuing computer science student who has been part of the [TRIO Program](https://www.evergreen.edu/offices-services/trio-student-success-disability-support/trio-services-application) , you can continue to work with them to request support

# Team Formation and Pair Programming
In this undergrad research, students will work in teams of one to three, dividing up tasks between them. If more than three students register, we will have the option to form two or more teams.
# How Will Students Be Evaluated for Credit
This undergrad research is worth a maximum of 6 credits titled "Distributed Gameplaying and Java Programming". Four credits will be awarded as upper division if a student has at least 80% attendance at all class sessions, submits 80% of homeworks, and participates in classroom discussion.
6 credits (all upper division) will be awarded if the team's player code beats the reference player on two out of three randomly chosen maps.

Students in the class will evaluate each other at mid-term (Week 5) and at the end of the quarter (Week 10) on the basis of communication amount and style to each other and effort in designing and implementing code features. Students will be awarded credit individually, but will work on the same player source code as a team.
# Timeliness

Students will receive their evaluations by the end of Week 10 to review before a Week 11 evaluation meeting. All work will be evaluated (homeworks in Canvas, commits to git) by Friday, 5pm, Week 10.

# Artificial Intelligence and Collaboration Policy
In this class, we emphasize the importance of following a collaboration policy to maximize learning and to develop good ethical habits for your future career. We based our collaboration policy on Evergreen's published standards on academic honesty.

Since 2022, we acknowledge that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI or AI) has become a transformative technology changing many aspects of work, business, social interaction, and particularly education. We will use AI as a blanket term below to primarily refer to natural language chat with a Language Model (LLM or SLM) using generative pre-trained transformers, since one strength of this approach is writing, generating, proofreading, and debugging code, core skills that we are developing in this class. Our policy on AI use for this class has the following tenets:

AI is a useful tool after you have mastered programming concepts by hand. This allows you to know how to ask an AI skillfully to achieve your goals now and in the future, to verify its results to know whether it is correct, trustworthy, or suitable to your purpose.

You wish to be a software engineer working for an organization. Some organizations  may allow AI use in your daily work, or have no real way to detect it. Many more will evaluate you on your own personal understanding, skills, and ability to communicate about them in a technical interview, without the use of AI. 

AI encourages some social and intellectual habits and discourages other. We ask you to consider the following aspects of an AI chat interaction and what behaviors it might enable or make easier, with possible consequences in training your own conscious or subconscious mind. AI chat allows one to ask and receive responses at any hour of the day or night. While beneficial in creating a sense of receiving timely attention with seemingly high quality information, it can create a false expectation of receiving the same kind of service from everyone, including other humans. Other humans may not be able to satisfy this demand, leading to possible disappointment or even a prejudice against humans. Alternatively, it may encourage humans to (over)extend themselves to appear competent. It creates the illusion that one is talking to a person with empathy, judgment, and self-control, 
It can encourage a kind of intellectual greed, the sense that one is entitled to know everything that one can pose a question about. It conceals its energy usage which is a cost currently born by the companies that own an AI model in order to encourage its usage (this argument also applies to web searches but to a lesser extent).
