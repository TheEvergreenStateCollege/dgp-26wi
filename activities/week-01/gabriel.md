1. Name three computer science topics and projects you've enjoyed learning and working on at Evergreen.
* I made a task manager using Python.
*   Probably not the task manager you're thinking of. All it did was let you record things and mark them as complete.
* I designed and implemented a database in MySQLWorkbench
* That's it. (or.. a secret third thing?)

2. What about a game (video, PC, board, card, or otherwise) makes it fun for you?
* Progression. I like it when games increase the power scale of all entities involved (players, monsters, world, etc.).

3. Can you give an example from an actual game you enjoy playing?
* Terraria, a "2D" pixel sandbox survival game. It's praised for its gameplay loop of crafting gear and fighting bosses.
* Here's an image of a boss fight that takes place in hell.

4. How would you describe a strategy for playing the game above in one sentence? (Does not need to be winning)
* Making a big flat platform to run on while you shoot projectiles at the pursuing boss or monster. 
5. What would you like to do with the ideas, skills, and knowledge you'll learn this quarter?
* something cool FIXME
