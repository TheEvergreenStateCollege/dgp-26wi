## <Your Name>

1. Name three computer science topics and projects you've enjoyed learning and working on at Evergreen.
Definitely data structures and algorithms help me get a strong grass on all the topics instructions that I was looking into studying and it helped my overall focused time increase
Another class I took was physical computing and 3-D modeling learning to work with vectors in images to be able to put into modeling software that allows me to three print them was immensely valuable especially at the time working at blue origin spacecraft and doing the same thing at work with aluminum products helped a ton
The third I really enjoyed working with my nonprofit and being able to build a front end for their website I'd truly enjoy front end even though I would rather be on the programming side deeper and the data side of course. 
2. What about a game (video, PC, board, card, or otherwise) makes it fun for you?
I actually read an article about this and it's definitely the freedom of exploitation and trying to use my memory to have a definite resolve games that have unlimited resolved and that go on forever without any achievements actually stress me out so I guess the games of the 90s that were when you would call Hackable I don't know.

3. Can you give an example from an actual game you enjoy playing?
   a. In another browser window, look up some game art or gameplay screenshots and copy them to your clipboard
   b. or take a screenshot from a game you are currently playing, if any.

4. How would you describe a strategy for playing the game above in one sentence? (Does not need to be winning)
Winning by scoring less points .. like golf 
5. What would you like to do with the ideas, skills, and knowledge you'll learn this quarter?
   a. In other words, what are your goals for taking this class?
I would like to have a playable game that I could share with recruiters in my job search
